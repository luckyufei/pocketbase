# Jobs Scheduling (JavaScript)

If you have tasks that need to be performed periodically, you could set up crontab-like jobs with `cronAdd(id, expr, handler)`.

Each scheduled job runs in its own goroutine as part of the `serve` command process and must have:

- **id** - identifier for the scheduled job; could be used to replace or remove an existing job
- **cron expression** - e.g. `0 0 * * *` *(supports numeric list, steps, ranges or macros like `@yearly`, `@annually`, `@monthly`, `@weekly`, `@daily`, `@midnight`, `@hourly`)*
- **handler** - the function that will be executed every time when the job runs

Here is an example:

```javascript
// prints "Hello!" every 2 minutes
cronAdd("hello", "*/2 * * * *", () => {
    console.log("Hello!")
})
```

To remove a single registered cron job you can call `cronRemove(id)`.

All registered app level cron jobs can be also previewed and triggered from the *Dashboard > Settings > Crons* section.
