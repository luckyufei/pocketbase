# Realtime messaging

By default PocketBase sends realtime events only for Record create/update/delete operations (*and for the OAuth2 auth redirect*), but you are free to send custom realtime messages to the connected clients via the [`$app.subscriptionsBroker()`](/jsvm/functions/_app.subscriptionsBroker.html) instance.

[`$app.subscriptionsBroker().clients()`](/jsvm/interfaces/subscriptions.Broker.html#clients) returns all connected [`subscriptions.Client`](/jsvm/interfaces/subscriptions.Client.html) indexed by their unique connection id.

The current auth record associated with a client could be accessed through `client.get("auth")`.

::: info
Note that a single authenticated user could have more than one active realtime connection (aka. multiple clients). This could happen for example when opening the same app in different tabs, browsers, devices, etc.
:::

Below you can find a minimal code sample that sends a JSON payload to all clients subscribed to the "example" topic:

```javascript
const message = new SubscriptionMessage({
    name: "example",
    data: JSON.stringify({ ... }),
});

// retrieve all clients (clients id indexed map)
const clients = $app.subscriptionsBroker().clients()

for (let clientId in clients) {
    if (clients[clientId].hasSubscription("example")) {
        clients[clientId].send(message)
    }
}
```

From the client-side, users can listen to the custom subscription topic by doing something like:

::: code-group
```javascript [JavaScript]
import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';

const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');

...

await pb.realtime.subscribe('example', (e) => {
    console.log(e)
})
```

```dart [Dart]
import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';

final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');

...

await pb.realtime.subscribe('example', (e) {
    print(e)
})
```
